      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">What is online shopping?</h4>
      <p> Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.

        An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices.
        
        Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, an Interac-enabled debit card, or a service such as PayPal. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to the customer; for digital products, such as digital audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba, Amazon.com, and eBay.[1]
        One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM's online transaction processing (OLTP) developed in the 1960s, which allowed the processing of financial transactions in real-time.[2] The computerized ticket reservation system developed for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications. There, computer terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed transactions simultaneously and coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same time.[2] At some point between 1971 and 1971, students at Stanford and MIT used the internet precursor ARPANET to make a deal to exchange marijuana, but the interaction doesn't qualify as e-commerce because no money was transferred online.[3]

The emergence of online shopping as it is known today developed with the emergence of the Internet.[4] Initially, this platform only functioned as an advertising tool for companies, providing information about their products. It quickly moved on from this simple utility to actual online shopping transaction due to the development of interactive Web pages and secure transmissions.[5] Specifically, the growth of the Internet as a secure shopping channel has developed since 1994, with the first sales of Sting's album Ten Summoner's Tales.[6] Wine, chocolates, and flowers soon followed and were among the pioneering retail categories which fueled the growth of online shopping. Researchers found that having products that are appropriate for e-commerce was a key indicator of Internet success.[7] Many of these products did well as they are generic products which shoppers did not need to touch and feel in order to buy. But also importantly, in the early days, there were few shoppers online and they were from a narrow segment: affluent, male, 30+. Online shopping has come a long way since those early days and – in the UK – accounts for significant percentage (depending on product category as percentages can vary).</p>
      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">History</h4>
      <p> Small-scale industries (SSI) are divided into modern and traditional industries. Traditional industries are home-based, use simple tools and equipment, depend on family labor, and are completely manual. Modern SSIs may have a separate workplace, employ outside labor, and use machines and power. Nearly all of the traditional industries and a very large number of modern SSIs fall into the unregistered category, so the GDP of these industries will be roughly equal to the GDP of the unregistered sector. The share of modern SSIs has improved greatly both in production and employment between 1973–1974 and 2002–2003: in production from 68 to 94 percent and in employment from 28 to 43 percent. Over the same period, the share of traditional industries declined: in production from 16 to 6 percent and in employment from 58 to 55 percent.

        An SSI is currently defined as an enterprise with investment in plant and machinery up to 10 million rupees (original value). This sector also includes ancillary, export-oriented, and women's enterprises, with an investment limit in each of 10 million rupees and with a special condition for each, and business and service enterprises in specified lines with investment limits of 2.5 million rupees and 0.5 million rupees, respectively, without any condition.Production, employment, and exports of SSI increased by 10.0, 5.9, and 12.7 percent per annum from 1973–1974 to 2000–2001. The subperiods 1973–1974, 1980–1981, 1990–1991, and 2000–2001 witnessed deceleration of growth on all the three measures.</p>

      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Support</h4>
      <p> It is on these considerations that various assistance programs and incentives have been devised for SSI development. Since independence in 1947, especially since the late 1950s, development has been wide-ranging, both in terms of programs and regions. The programs include information and technology services, entrepreneurship development and training, modernization and technology support, industrial facilities, assistance in procurement of raw materials price preferences, finance, and nursing of "sick" industrial units. To operate these programs and to monitor their progress, new agencies and institutions have been set up, and the existing ones strengthened at the national, regional, state, and lower levels. There is also a special bank for SSIs. The SSIs have their own associations, and are also represented in the national- and state-level associations of large-scale industries.

        An attempt was made to estimate the value of incentives on SSI production. The study examined nine programs or incentive schemes for six industries in seven states. It was estimated that the value varied from 70 percent in cosmetics and toiletries to 33 percent in gases.This is some placeholder content for the scrollspy page. Note that as you scroll down the page, the appropriate navigation link is highlighted. It's repeated throughout the component example. We keep adding some more example copy here to emphasize the scrolling and highlighting. In 1972 SSIs producing metals and electrical equipment had the largest share in the number of units, employment, and fixed assets and production, 43–49 percent. Other manufacturing, food, textiles, and services followed, in that order. In 1987–1988, other manufacturing was first in each of the above categories, with a share of 35–42 percent, followed in each category by metals and electricals, food, textiles, and services. The share of food and textiles increased and that of metals and electricals declined, both substantially.</p>
